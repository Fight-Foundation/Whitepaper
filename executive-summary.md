# Executive Summary

Fight is a licensed Web3 ecosystem that turns combat-sports fandom into ownership. It runs on three pillars:

1. **Identity (FightID)** — a portable, on-chain identity for fans and fighters.  
2. **Reputation (FP points)** — non-transferable “Fighting Points” that reflect participation and unlock ecosystem utility.  
3. **Ownership ($FIGHT)** — a Solana-based token used across the ecosystem for access, staking, governance, fees, and rewards.  

$FIGHT is an **IP token** supported by the UFC through licensing and sponsorship relationships held by **Concept Labs**, a core contributor to the project. UFC and Fight.ID publicly announced a multi-year collaboration to grow UFC’s digital fanbase with loyalty experiences, Prize$Fight fighter bonuses, and FightGear premium apparel aligned with the Fight ecosystem.

**Flagship utility: Prediction Markets** — a token-based, fantasy-style product synchronized to the UFC fight calendar. This experience, combined with fighter communities, merchandise and ticketing rails, and partner activations, channels ecosystem activity through transparent, DAO-governed fee flows and treasury programs.

## Why this matters

UFC gives Fight both distribution and cultural legitimacy at global scale. Each fight week becomes an acquisition moment that drives fans through the ecosystem funnel:  
**UFC reach → FightID → FP → $FIGHT**.  

Our long-term ambition is to onboard over 700 million mainstream fans into Web3 through simple, rewarding experiences that tie participation to identity and reputation.  

Under **DAO treasury policies**, portions of net protocol revenues may be allocated to ecosystem operations, community grants, and other programs approved through on-chain governance. These allocations are **not intended as investment returns or price support** and may be modified or discontinued at any time based on community decisions and program priorities.
