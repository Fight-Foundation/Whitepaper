# Executive Summary

**Fight is the Web3 home of combat-sports fandom** — a licensed ecosystem built by the developers behind UFC Strike and powered by **Fight.ID**, the official digital gateway for MMA and fight culture. It runs on three pillars:

1. **Identity (FightID)** — a portable, on-chain identity for fans and fighters.  
2. **Reputation (FP points)** — non-transferable "Fighting Points" that reflect participation and unlock ecosystem utility.  
3. **Ownership ($FIGHT)** — a Solana-based ecosystem token for combat sports that powers access, staking, governance, fees, and rewards.  

**Fight.ID is a partner of the UFC.** The UFC and Fight.ID have publicly announced a multi-year collaboration to grow the UFC's digital fanbase with loyalty experiences, Prize$Fight fighter bonuses, and FightGear premium apparel.

**Flagship utility: Prediction Markets** — a token-based, fantasy-style product synchronized to the global MMA calendar. This experience, combined with fighter communities, merchandise and ticketing rails, and partner activations, channels ecosystem activity through transparent, DAO-governed fee flows and treasury programs.

## Why this matters

Fight.ID's partnership with the UFC provides real distribution and cultural legitimacy at global scale. Each fight week becomes an acquisition moment that drives fans through the ecosystem funnel:  
**UFC reach → FightID → FP → $FIGHT**.  

With a team embedded deep in the sport and real distribution through the Fight.ID partner network, Fight is onboarding millions into a unified, high-energy, tokenized combat-sports economy. **$FIGHT turns every card, every storyline, and every fighter moment into tradable, community-driven participation** — the digital pulse of the fight world.

Under **DAO treasury policies**, portions of net protocol revenues may be allocated to ecosystem operations, community grants, and other programs approved through on-chain governance. These allocations are **not intended as investment returns or price support** and may be modified or discontinued at any time based on community decisions and program priorities.
