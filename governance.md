# Governance Charter

## Overview

The **Fight Foundation** oversees the governance framework of the Fight ecosystem — including the $FIGHT token, its on-chain treasury, and associated community programs.  
Its purpose is to steward decentralization, uphold transparency, and ensure compliance as control progressively transitions to the Fight DAO.

Fight operates as a **community-governed protocol**, supported initially by the Foundation and core contributors such as **Concept Labs** and **FightFi Labs**, with oversight and input from the **Athlete Council**.

---

## Mandate of the Fight Foundation

The Foundation’s role is to act as an independent, non-profit steward of the Fight ecosystem during its formative stages.  
Its core responsibilities include:

- **Safeguarding** the protocol’s intellectual property, trademarks, and brand partnerships.  
- **Executing** on DAO-approved proposals and maintaining transparent accounting of all treasury operations.  
- **Ensuring** compliance with applicable laws and regulations across jurisdictions.  
- **Facilitating** the transition to on-chain community governance and DAO autonomy.  

The Foundation does **not** exist to manage the market value of the $FIGHT token or to guarantee returns of any kind.  
All token operations and treasury programs are governed by published policies and may be amended through DAO processes.

---

## Principles of Governance

The Fight ecosystem is built on four foundational principles that guide both decision-making and behavior:

1. **Fight Fair** – Design for integrity. Operate transparently. Resolve disputes openly.  
2. **Fight Together** – Fans × Fighters × Builders share aligned upside through participation.  
3. **Fight Through** – Ship fast, fix fast. Maintain accountability and adapt during fight week cycles.  
4. **Fight Forever** – Build for longevity with compliance, security, and durable economics.

These principles serve as the moral and operational compass for all Foundation and DAO actions.

---

## Governance Phases

### **Phase 1: Foundation Stewardship (Launch – Year 1)**  
During this phase, the Foundation maintains operational control to ensure security and legal compliance.  
Key decisions — emissions, grants, liquidity operations, and strategic partnerships — are approved by the Foundation under public reporting standards.

**Transparency Measures:**
- Quarterly treasury reports published on-chain.  
- Public disclosure of all multisig signers and rotation policies.  
- Mandatory audits of key smart contracts and emission schedules.  

---

### **Phase 2: Delegate Program (Year 2)**  
As the ecosystem matures, governance expands to include **community delegates** and **working groups** representing the following areas:

- **Product & UX** – roadmap prioritization and protocol parameters  
- **Treasury & Grants** – fund allocation and performance tracking  
- **Risk & Integrity** – oracle operations, dispute resolution, and compliance review  
- **Athlete Council** – fighter alignment, fairness, and fan experience  

Delegates are elected or self-nominated by $FIGHT holders and evaluated based on participation, transparency, and measurable contributions.

---

### **Phase 3: Full DAO Execution (Year 3+)**  
Ultimate authority transitions to on-chain governance, with proposals and votes executed directly via smart contracts.  
All key actions — emissions updates, treasury disbursements, parameter changes — are subject to **token-holder voting, quorum thresholds, and timelocked execution.**

DAO governance is designed for accountability:
- All proposal data, voting results, and execution transactions are recorded on-chain.  
- Emergency powers are narrowly scoped, time-limited, and require renewal by token vote.  
- Dispute and arbitration mechanisms are transparent and documented.  

---

## Proposals and Voting

Any $FIGHT holder may submit or sponsor a governance proposal once minimum thresholds are met (for example, a defined token stake or delegate sponsorship).

Each proposal follows a clear lifecycle:

1. **Draft (RFC):** Community discussion on the governance forum.  
2. **Formal Submission:** Verified on-chain submission or delegate sponsorship.  
3. **Vote:** Token-based voting with quorum and time limits.  
4. **Execution:** Successful proposals implemented via timelocked contracts.

FP (Fighting Points) may serve as a **reputation modifier** — boosting the visibility of long-term contributors or gating proposal creation — without overriding token-holder consensus.

---

## Treasury Policy

The DAO Treasury receives protocol-generated revenues such as ecosystem fees, grant returns, or partner contributions.  
All treasury operations follow these guiding principles:

- **Transparency:** On-chain reporting of inflows, outflows, and reserves.  
- **Accountability:** Programs must define measurable KPIs and milestones.  
- **Community Oversight:** Treasury allocations are subject to DAO votes.  
- **Flexibility:** The DAO may amend, pause, or discontinue programs through governance.

Under DAO policy, portions of net protocol revenues **may be allocated** to operations, grants, liquidity programs, or other initiatives that expand ecosystem utility.  
These allocations are **not intended as investment returns or price support**, and may change at any time through community governance.

---

## Athlete Council Integration

The **Athlete Council** acts as a formal advisory body to ensure that fighters’ perspectives are represented in governance and treasury decisions.  
It advises on:
- Fighter community programs and staking models.  
- Prize$Fight allocation frameworks.  
- Integrity, safety, and fairness guidelines.  

Council members serve rotating terms and are compensated via milestone-based, DAO-approved token streams.

---

## Transparency & Accountability

All governance actions and treasury operations are tracked via a public **Transparency Dashboard**, which displays:
- DAO proposal status and history.  
- Treasury balances and disbursements.  
- Emission schedules and vesting progress.  
- Council and delegate participation metrics.  

Audited reports are published quarterly, and governance documentation is maintained openly on-chain and in the official GitBook.

---

## Disclaimer

This governance framework is provided for informational and transparency purposes.  
Nothing in this Charter constitutes an offer of securities, investment advice, or a guarantee of future value.  
All policies and parameters may be amended through DAO governance or regulatory requirements as the ecosystem evolves.
