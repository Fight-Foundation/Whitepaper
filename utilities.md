# Ecosystem Utility

The Fight ecosystem supports multiple utility surfaces that transform combat-sports fandom into recurring, value-accruing participation. These utilities may be built by partners or developed in-house, but all integrate the Fight standard: **FightID** (identity), **FP** (reputation), and **$FIGHT** (ownership). Each utility is synchronized to UFC's event cadence and denominated in $FIGHT.

---

## 1. Prediction Markets

**Fantasy- and culture-based games** (not wagering on fight results) where fans use **$FIGHT** to enter skill-based challenges. Predictions cover MMA culture: card announcements, walkout aesthetics, media moments, training camps, merch themes, and creator challenges.

**Examples:** "Which city hosts the next PPV?", "What color will O'Malley's hair be next fight week?", "Which gym signs a top-10 bantamweight this quarter?"

Entries are scored against **objective, pre-published resolution sources** (UFC announcements, fighter posts, broadcast assets, on-chain metadata). Fans compete in seasonal leaderboards, club tournaments inside fighter communities, and creator-hosted games that reward high-FP performance.

**Why it matters:** Transforms passive viewership into active participation. UFC's reliable event cadence creates weekly utility. Over time, fans build reputations, develop strategies, and gain social clout connected to FP and fighter communities.

**Value accrual:** Market **maker/taker/settlement fees** are collected in $FIGHT and distributed via programmable splits to the **DAO treasury**, **liquidity providers**, and an automated **buyback/burn module**. Seasonal leaderboards, FP multipliers, and club tournaments increase entry frequency and stake depth.

**Integrity:** Identity-anchored via **FightID** with **anti-sybil** protections and **staking-velocity** limits. Results verified through vetted **oracles** with transparent **DAO dispute-resolution** processes. Analytics monitoring detects manipulation.

**Compliance:** Built with **jurisdictional controls** from day one. Geofencing, licensed partnerships, and skill-based fantasy formats ensure global reach while respecting local regulations.

## 2. Fighter Communities & Staking

On-chain fan clubs where membership requires **staking $FIGHT**. Each fighter's community offers exclusive content, AMAs, watch-alongs, merch drops, prediction tournaments, and Prize$Fight bounties. Fans maintain membership by keeping their stake active and can upgrade tiers through increased stake or higher **FP**.

**Core mechanics:**

- **Dynamic entry pricing:** Stake requirements rise as membership grows, rewarding early supporters with lower costs and higher status.
- **Reward routing:** Portions of join fees and community revenues flow to existing members (pro-rata or tier-weighted) and to the **DAO treasury**—funding grants, buybacks/burns, and member retention.
- **FP multipliers:** High-FP members receive boosted staking yields, priority access to premium experiences, allowlists for drops, and better odds in community raffles.

**Why it matters:** Creates durable, authentic fandoms with real economic alignment. Stake requirements make membership intentional; dynamic pricing rewards discovery; FP-based boosts reward consistent participation. Fight-week moments become programmed touchpoints that convert attention into membership and retention.

**Value accrual:** Staking locks remove tokens from circulation; community actions generate **$FIGHT-denominated fees** routed to the DAO for **buybacks/burns** and to members for retention; FP boosts increase stake duration. UFC-aligned moments drive new joins → higher entry prices → more fees to members and DAO → growth and buybacks/burns → rising community value.

**Safeguards:** Community parameters (entry curves, reward splits, eligibility) are DAO-governed with Athlete Council input. **FightID** gating mitigates sybil abuse; rate limits and audit trails preserve integrity.

## 3. Additional Utility Surfaces

### FightGear

Premium combat-sports lifestyle brand featuring limited-run capsule drops, fighter collaborations, and event-themed collections. Access token-gated through **FightID**, with early windows for **$FIGHT** holders and high-**FP** members. Checkout supports $FIGHT alongside conventional payment rails.

**Why it matters:** Apparel acts as a viral surface extending the brand into the real world. Converts casual awareness into **FightID** claims and repeat engagement. Traditional apparel business bringing revenue and profits to the ecosystem.

**Value accrual:** Purchases, holder discounts, and royalties denominated in **$FIGHT**. Programmable share of net proceeds flows to **DAO treasury** for **buybacks/burns**, builder grants, and future drops.

---

### Prize$Fight

Programmable prize-pool framework for **fighter bonuses**, **fan challenges**, and **event-based bounties** (e.g., "Finish of the Night," "Fan MVP," "Underdog Upset"). Pools funded by sponsors, community initiatives, or DAO allocations. Disbursed transparently on-chain with **Athlete Council** guidance.

**Why it matters:** Turns fan support into tangible rewards for athletes. Aligns incentives—fighters rewarded for memorable performances, fans for engagement and prediction skill, sponsors for measurable activation. What benefits fighters benefits fans, and vice versa.

**Value accrual:** Funding, pledges, and entry fees denominated in **$FIGHT**. Protocol fee routes to treasury for **buybacks/burns** and future campaigns. Clusters around fight week, driving new **FightID** sign-ups and repeat token usage. Some bonuses time-locked until fighter retirement, reducing float.

---

### FightHub

Network of partner apps, leagues, and utilities integrating the Fight standard: **FightID** (identity), **FP** (reputation), and **$FIGHT** (ownership). Partners use SDKs/APIs to honor user identity and status, accept $FIGHT for access/fees, and feed engagement data back into the ecosystem.

**Why it matters:** Expands where fan identity and reputation matter without fragmentation. Unified layer lets fans carry their handle, FP, and access rights everywhere. Partners tap into UFC-synchronized distribution and engaged audience, lowering integration cost and accelerating go-to-market.

**Value accrual:** Each integration adds new **utility surfaces** and **fee streams** (subscriptions, upgrades, entries, settlement) denominated in **$FIGHT**. Standard revenue-share routes portions to **DAO treasury** for **buybacks/burns**, liquidity programs, and builder grants seeding the next wave of partners.

## Revenue Model & Value Routing

All utility surfaces generate $FIGHT-denominated fees flowing to the DAO treasury under transparent policies.

| Utility | Revenue Streams | Cadence |
|---------|----------------|---------|
| **Prediction Markets** | Maker/taker/settlement fees, seasonal passes | Weekly (fight-week) |
| **Fighter Communities** | Join/upgrade fees, tournaments | Ongoing |
| **FightGear** | Sales, royalties, holder discounts | Event & drop cycles |
| **Prize$Fight** | Protocol fee on funding & entries | Event-based |
| **FightHub Partners** | Revenue-share from integrations | Variable |
| **NFTs & Collectibles** | Sales, marketplace fees, royalties | Event-aligned |
| **Ticketing & Merch** | Transaction fees, partner shares | Event cycles |

### Value Routing

Portions of **net revenues** flow to the **DAO treasury** in **$FIGHT**. The DAO allocates proceeds to:

- **Buybacks and burns** — reduces circulating supply over time
- **Ecosystem grants** — drives new product surfaces and user growth
- **Liquidity operations** — smooth onboarding for mainstream fans

### The Flywheel

UFC's cadence supplies distribution → FightID and FP convert attention into value-creating actions → $FIGHT-denominated revenues fund buybacks/burns and next-wave growth → compounding cycle where **real usage directly supports token value**, card after card, season after season.
